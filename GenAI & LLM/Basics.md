### Machine Learning (ML)
- Focus on text analysis
- Uses ML algorithms to learn patterns from data
- Does not require explicit programming
- Early attempts to simulate human language processing

### Deep Learning (DL)
- Enabled by advancements in hardware technology (GPUs, TPUs)
- Built on Neural Networks (NNs)
- Significantly improved language programming
- Better handling of words, sentences, and context
- More accurate human language interpretation

### Virtual Assistants Evolution
- Excelled at interpreting human language
- Capable of taking actions based on user intent
  
Initially limited to:
- Answering queries using predefined scripts
- Rule-based responses
  
Later expanded to:
- Connecting to third-party services
- Performing tasks (e.g., bookings, reminders)


## Generative AI 
- subset of DL that **creates new data** rather than just classifying existing data
### Transformers
- Emerged as a breakthrough architecture
- Can process longer text sequences as input
- Capture context and relationships across entire text
- **Foundation for Large Language Models (LLMs)**

## LLM
- A type of Generative AI
- Trained on very large amounts of text (sometimes images, audio, etc.)
- Designed to predict and generate language
- Called “large” because they have billions of parameters.
    - Parameters are learned weights that guide predictions
- Generate text by predicting the most likely next word (token)
  
## what LLMs can do:

| Task      | Example           | 
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Text generation | writing articles, summaries, emails |
| Question answering | providing direct factual or contextual responses |
| Creative content | ideation, stories, explanations |
| Educational tools | generating practice questions, explanations at different reading levels |
